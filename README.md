# WarHammer

## What we have

This repository holds the code necessary to run a python script that as of now gives you a random race and ability scores (once and in order).

The other piece of code needed for this to work is the class Dice.py

## Installation

We will need python 3 installed for these programs to run.
If you do not already, you will want to install Anaconda, because it's the bomb digity!
you need to install the following as well:

- `conda install numpy`
- `conda install pandas`

## How to use this code

- First download: Make_a_warhammer_PC.py, Dice.py, CareerTable.csv
- Second, open Make_a_warhammer_PC.py and change the shebang to your PATH
- (If you didn't understand step two send me a message)
- Next, open up the command line and run the command:
- `./Make_a_warhammer_PC.py > filename.txt`

This will output the text to the file you speify!
